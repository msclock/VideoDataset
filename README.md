## Overview

VideoDataset is a high-performance video decoding multi-framework supporting library. It aims to provide framework-integrated solutions for working with video decoding tasks.

Key Features:

- GPU-accelerated video decoding using NvCodec library
- Support for common video formats (H.264, H.265, etc.)
- Easy integration with multi-frameworks and multi-formats.

## Documentation

Full documentation is available at: [Documentation](https://AgiBot-World.github.io/VideoDataset).

Also, a sphinx-based documentation can be generated by running the following command:

```bash
make dev-doc doc-coverage
```

It will generate the documentation in the `docs/_build/html` directory and serve it on <http://localhost:8000>.
